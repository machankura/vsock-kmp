# vsockk

`vsockk` is a Kotlin library for the JVM that facilitates Virtual Socket (VSOCK) communication using the Java Native Interface (JNI). It is adapted from the `vsockj` library (https://github.com/Cloud-Architects/vsockj) to provide a Kotlin-centric API for seamless VSOCK integration on platforms that supports VSOCK.
